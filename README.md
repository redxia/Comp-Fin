Computational Methods in Finance

This course introduces some of the major numerical methods needed for quantitative work in finance,
focusing on derivatives pricing and fixed income applications. Topics will include the binomial
method for European, American and various Exotic options pricing, treatment of discrete dividends,
American bond option valuations, numerical methods for stochastic differential equations, random
number generators, Monte-Carlo methods for European and Least-Square Monte-Carlo methods for
American options pricing. Variance reduction techniques will be covered. We will also cover the
Low-Discrepancy Sequences and implement the Quasi Monte Carlo method. The numerical methods
of the partial differential equations and finite difference methods that appear in financial engineering
will be covered.
