# Problem 2(b)
```{r }
histBern <- read.delim("q2.txt",sep = '\n', header = FALSE)
hist(histBern$V1, main = "Bernoulli Distribution of LGM X_0 = 5" , xlab = "X = {-1,0,1,2}")
```

# Problem 3(b)
```{r}
histBin <- read.delim("q3b.txt",sep = '\n', header = FALSE)
hist(histBin$V1, main = "Binomial Distribution of LGM Algorithm", breaks = 30)
prob40Greater <- 1 - pbinom(39,size = 44, p = 0.64) 
prob40Greater
```
The Probability for P(X >= 40) is 4.823664e-05, which is very close to zero
This is why we have zero in our C++. None of it passed 40.

# Problem 4c
```{r}
histexp <- read.delim("q4c.txt",sep = '\n', header = FALSE)
hist(histexp$V1, main = "Exponential Distribution of LGM Algorithm", breaks = 25)
```
